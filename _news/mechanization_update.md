The
[workshop](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/mechanization-and-mathematical-research.html)
and [public symposium](https://sites.google.com/view/mechanicalmath) on
mechanization of mathematics are at full capacity, and registration is now
closed. Unfortunately we cannot accommodate unregistered walk-ins. Recordings of the symposium will be made
available shortly after the even.
