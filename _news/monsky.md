A group of [UvA](https://kdvi.uva.nl/) students, PhD students, and postdocs
have formalized the proof of [Monsky's
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsky%27s_theorem) in
[Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)! See their [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/dhyan-aranha/Monsky/tree/main).
